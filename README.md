## Introduction
This repository contains practical programming examples of various data structures. Each implementation is accompanied by clear explanations, use cases, and code examples to help users understand the concepts thoroughly.

## Data Structures Covered

### List
- Introduction to lists.
- Operations: Traversal, Insertion, Deletion, Searching, and Sorting.
- Example programs demonstrating list manipulations.

### Implementation of Structures 
- Explanation of structures and their use in organizing data.
- Examples of defining and using structures in programs.

### Linked List
- Singly Linked List: Creation, traversal, insertion, and deletion.
- Circular Linked List: Features and implementation.
- Common operations with linked lists.

### Tree
- Binary Trees: Creation, traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
- Binary Search Trees (BST): Insertion, search, and deletion.
- Other tree types like AVL trees and heap trees.

### Hash Function
- Introduction to hashing.
- Implementation of hash functions.
- Collision handling techniques like chaining and open addressing.

### Doubly Linked List
- Explanation and implementation of doubly linked lists.
- Operations: Insertion, deletion, traversal (both directions).

### Stacks
- Implementation of stacks using arrays and linked lists.
- Operations: Push, Pop, Peek, and checking for stack overflow/underflow.
- Applications of stacks: Expression evaluation, backtracking.

### Queues
- Implementation of queues using arrays and linked lists.
- Types of queues: Simple, circular, and priority queues.
- Operations: Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek.
