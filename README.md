## 📂 Data Structures Covered

### 📜 List
- **Introduction**: A list is a sequence of elements where duplicates are allowed, and the order is maintained.
- **Operations**:
  - **Traversal**: Accessing each element in the list.
  - **Insertion**: Adding elements at specific positions.
  - **Deletion**: Removing elements by value or position.
  - **Searching**: Locating elements in the list.
  - **Sorting**: Arranging elements in a particular order.
- **Example Programs**:
  - Reversing a list.
  - Sorting a list using bubble sort.
  - Finding the largest element in a list.

### 🏗️ Implementation of Structures
- **Overview**: Structures are user-defined data types that allow grouping related variables.
- **Applications**:
  - Representing complex entities like student records, employee details, etc.
  - Useful in competitive programming for managing multiple fields.
- **Examples**:
  - Define a structure for a student with fields like `name`, `age`, and `grade`.
  - Implement operations to input and display data stored in a structure.

### 🔗 Linked List
- **Singly Linked List**:
  - Nodes contain data and a pointer to the next node.
  - Operations:
    - **Creation**: Initialize a linked list.
    - **Traversal**: Visit all nodes.
    - **Insertion**: Add nodes at the beginning, middle, or end.
    - **Deletion**: Remove nodes by value or position.
- **Circular Linked List**:
  - Features:
    - The last node points to the first node.
    - Efficient for tasks requiring circular iteration.
  - **Implementation**: Create and manipulate circular linked lists.
- **Common Use Cases**:
  - Dynamic memory allocation.
  - Representing hierarchical data like a menu system.

### 🌳 Tree
- **Binary Tree**:
  - Hierarchical structure where each node has up to two children.
  - **Traversals**:
    - **In-order**: Left, Root, Right.
    - **Pre-order**: Root, Left, Right.
    - **Post-order**: Left, Right, Root.
  - Applications: Expression evaluation, game trees.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**:
  - Organized for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion.
  - Operations:
    - Insert elements while maintaining sorted order.
    - Search for elements using binary logic.
- **Advanced Trees**:
  - **AVL Tree**: A self-balancing BST.
  - **Heap Tree**: Used in priority queues and heap sort.

### 🗝️ Hash Functions
- **Introduction**: Hashing maps data to a fixed-size value (hash code) for quick access.
- **Implementation**:
  - Create hash functions to index data.
  - Handle collisions using techniques like:
    - **Chaining**: Store multiple items at the same index using linked lists.
    - **Open Addressing**: Probe for the next available index.
- **Applications**:
  - Dictionary operations.
  - Caching mechanisms.

### ↔️ Doubly Linked List
- **Definition**: Each node contains data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node.
- **Operations**:
  - Insertion at the beginning, middle, or end.
  - Deletion from any position.
  - Traversal in both forward and reverse directions.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Undo functionality in text editors.
  - Browser history navigation.

### 📦 Stacks
- **Overview**: A linear data structure following LIFO (Last In, First Out).
- **Implementation**:
  - Using arrays or linked lists.
- **Operations**:
  - **Push**: Add elements to the top.
  - **Pop**: Remove elements from the top.
  - **Peek**: View the top element.
  - **Overflow/Underflow**: Handle stack size constraints.
- **Applications**:
  - Expression evaluation.
  - Backtracking algorithms.
  - Managing function calls (call stack).

### 🚶‍♂️ Queues
- **Overview**: A linear data structure following FIFO (First In, First Out).
- **Implementation**:
  - Using arrays or linked lists.
- **Types**:
  - **Simple Queue**: Basic enqueue and dequeue operations.
  - **Circular Queue**: Efficient utilization of memory.
  - **Priority Queue**: Elements have priorities; higher-priority elements are dequeued first.
- **Operations**:
  - **Enqueue**: Add elements to the rear.
  - **Dequeue**: Remove elements from the front.
  - **Peek**: View the front element.
- **Applications**:
  - Task scheduling.
  - Managing print jobs.
  - Breadth-first search (BFS) in graphs.

### 🌐 Graphs
- **Definition**: A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
- **Representation**:
  - **Adjacency Matrix**: 2D array to store connections.
  - **Adjacency List**: List of neighbors for each vertex.
- **Types**:
  - Directed vs. Undirected graphs.
  - Weighted vs. Unweighted graphs.
- **Algorithms**:
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explore as far as possible along each branch.
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explore all neighbors before moving deeper.
  - **Shortest Path**: Dijkstra’s algorithm, Bellman-Ford algorithm.
- **Applications**:
  - Social networks.
  - Network routing.
  - Solving puzzles like mazes.
